WE DEPRECTATED THIS REPOSITORY
================================

The new one is at https://github.com/InformationIntegrationGroup/Web-Karma

We used to have two repos, a private one called Web-Karma where we did all our development and a Web-Karma-Public where we pushed stable releases.
We made Web-Karma public so you can check out the different branches, see what we are doing, and hopefully help us.

We thank our users for their support and help while we learn how to participate fully in the open source community.

For people who land here, a short blurb:
Karma is an information integration tool that enables users to quickly and easily integrate data from a variety of data sources including databases, spreadsheets, delimited text files, XML, JSON, KML and Web APIs. Users integrate information by modeling it according to an ontology of their choice using a graphical user interface that automates much of the process. Karma learns to recognize the mapping of data to ontology classes and then uses the ontology to propose a model that ties together these classes. Users then interact with the system to adjust the automatically generated model. During this process, users can transform the data as needed to normalize data expressed in different formats and to restructure it. Once the model is complete, users can published the integrated data as RDF or store it in a database.
